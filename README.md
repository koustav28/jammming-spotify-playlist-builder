- **CSS Modules**: Modular styling approach for component-specific styles
- **Spotify Web API**: Integration for music data and playlist management
- **GitHub**: Version control and project hosting

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained experience with:

- Building a multi-component React application
- Managing application state using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Implementing OAuth authentication flow
- Working with REST APIs and handling asynchronous operations
- Using CSS Modules for styled components
- Props management and component communication
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Areas for Improvement

1. **API Implementation**:
   - Currently relies heavily on example code and Copilot
   - Need to better understand OAuth flows and API documentation
   - Goal: Implement API integrations from scratch in future projects

2. **Testing**:
   - Currently lacks test coverage
   - Need to implement:
     - Unit tests for components
     - Integration tests for API calls
     - End-to-end testing

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Create shareable playlist links
- [ ] Add loading animations
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Mobile Compatibility
